# Introduction
The famous Thomas Alfa Edison once said, “There is no substitute for hard work”. It has been a guiding principle that has kept me motivated throughout this Google Analytics course. In this case study, we will delve into the data of Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company, using the data analysis steps of Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. 
This report aims to highlight the skills I have developed throughout the course and to provide valuable insights that can assist the company in making data-driven decisions.

## Scenario
In this scenario, I will be taking the position of a junior data analyst on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic. The marketing director, Lily Moreno, believes that Cyclistic’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members utilize Cyclistic bikes differently. We will design a new marketing strategy from these insights to convert casual into annual members. 
However, the executives must approve our recommendations, so we must back them up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

## About the Company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. This offering allows customers to unlock a bike from one station and return it to any other station across Chicago. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations.  

Up until now, the company has focused on creating widespread awareness and targeting a wide range of consumers. The company offers a variety of pricing plans to suit different needs: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. People who buy single-ride or full-day passes are known as casual riders, while those who opt for annual memberships are referred to as Cyclistic members.

According to Cyclistic's financial analysts, annual members generate significantly higher profits compared to casual riders. As a result, the company marketing director, Moreno, believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be the key aspect to future growth. She thinks the company should prioritize converting casual riders into members since they are already familiar with the program and have chosen it for their mobility needs. However, in order to do that, the team needs to understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Therefore, the team are interested in analyzing the historical bike trips to identify trends.
